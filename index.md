#### [Image Classifier with MobileNet](https://share.streamlit.io/danokeefe/image-classifier/main/image_app.py)
  - Multi-page web application that allows users to classify an image of an object. 
  - Provides two methods of image input. The user can upload an image or provide an a URL to an image online.
  - The web app processes the image for input into MobileNet and captions the image with the output prediction.
  - GitHub repo for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DanOKeefe/Image-Classifier/tree/main).
  - Model is trained on 1,000 classes, listed [here](https://github.com/DanOKeefe/Image-Classifier/blob/main/imagenet_classes.txt).

  - Web application developed with Streamlit classify Iris flowers.
  - User can customize model input values using sliders in the sidebar.
  - Visualizes confidence of the model's prediction with Plotly.
  - Visualizes the user input compared to other datapoints on a PCA plot.
  - GitHub repo for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DanOKeefe/Streamlit_Iris_Classifier).
